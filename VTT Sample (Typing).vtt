00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>So here's the story I went to best buy today.</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.760
I had my eyes on this specific keyboard,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.350
the Logitech G 15 TLK, no num pad.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
I have an extension for that. Very nice mechanical keyboard, pretty pricey,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.380
but I've wanted it for several months now.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.880
And I've been saving up for it if you will.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.610
So I went to best buy and they didn't have, they had it,

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
but they had the version with cookie keys and I don't like clicky keys for

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.150
almost a year. Now I have been using this keyboard.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.030
It is a 60% keyboard if you'd like to know more about it,

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.810
check out this video here, but it is quite cliquey. For example,

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.750
I can do a test on monkey type and it sounds like this,

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.290
which is loud, in my opinion,

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.620
also in pretty much all the typing videos prior to that one,

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.290
I used wireless keyboards,

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.810
such that they were like membrane or chiclet or whatever, keyboards,

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.310
not mechanical. So I got a $30 multi-device keyboard for two reasons. One,

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.790
because I thought I'm done with this mechanical keyboard. I just,

19
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.890
I really want my arrow keys. And two, when I saw it, it's 30 bucks.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.383
I was like, Hey,

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360
I am getting kind of annoyed that there's no iMessage client for the computer

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.590
that I can't use my keyboard to type.

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.930
So what if I just paired this and used it for my phone as well?

24
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.190
Which you can do. So this is the Logitech [inaudible], but anyway,

25
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.880
I thought this would make for an entertaining video in terms of people who

26
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.210
always say that you can't type fast on chiclet keyboards or whatever.

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.540
Now membrane ghosting is a thing I have experienced in the past.

28
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.060
People say mechanical keyboards are the best. This tape is strong.

29
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.890
It's videos, not scripted at all. By the way,

30
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.230
if you couldn't tell by the fact that I'm doing this on a whim,

31
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.100
I was going to go ahead and make a video on the TLK and be like,

32
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.280
this is the mechanical keyboard. I want it for like a year and a half.

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.340
I li I really liked a lot of tech. I'm not affiliate with Logitech.

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
I'm gonna no, one's paying me whatever. Okay. Look at that.

35
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.570
Pretty nice. Very straightforward. Again, this was, you know,

36
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.580
$30 affordable is almost an understatement

37
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.720
now, to be honest, I don't really like this keyboard. It's got circular keys.

38
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.710
It's got like these circular keys and it doesn't make any sound,

39
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.750
which is something I got used to with the mechanical keyboard.

40
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.980
So I wanted the tactile keys versus linear it's. Craig is bad will happen.

41
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.580
I'm not sure if this was supposed to become an unboxing video. Definitely.

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.790
Honestly, I love the size of it.

43
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.910
Suddenly a third reason to have this is just like, if,

44
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.210
and when I do get that Logitech TLK would come with batteries in it. Nice.

45
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.080
Then this is a nice travel keyboard. Um,

46
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.760
I originally thought that about the mechanical keyboard,

47
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.310
but I'm not about to pull that keyboard out in the library when you're trying to

48
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.390
edit a video and then you have to use the alt key and function. It's

49
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.000
goddamn mess. This is the keyboard, nothing special. Again,

50
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.250
it's got like circular keys, which I don't know if I'm a huge fan of,

51
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.190
but these three buttons changed devices. This is not a keyboard review.

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.560
This is to see, can I get a high words per minute test?

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.030
So what are the pairing devices? Oh, the instructions are in.

54
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.960
I don't know what language that is fascinating. All right.

55
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.490
So let's go ahead and open the Bluetooth settings.

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.950
Okay, here we go. Screw the windows 10 settings, right?

57
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.210
That's so weird. Very informal video. Again.

58
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.770
Let's go ahead and go to monkey type.

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.350
We'll do a 15 second tests for the sake of time.

60
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.330
Let's do a test with mechanical keyboard,

61
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.380
One 50 row and 74. Okay. Let's move this.

62
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.890
So can I get one 50 raw, 1 74 with this keyboard?

63
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.660
So one thing I noticed that the keys are spaced differently. First of all,

64
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.160
okay. This is just a red at this point.

65
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.590
So this is why I like these keyboards more.

66
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.320
Not because I can type faster on them, but because they feel nicer,

67
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.290
I can just slide my fingers across the, you know,

68
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.750
you don't have to press down very far. That's, what's nice about that.

69
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.070
G nine 15, I talked about, but these, you have to go all the way down.

70
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.260
You don't have to, you don't have to bottom out,

71
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.010
but that's just what I'm used to. And so there is time there.

72
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.730
So let's do a new one. Do, can I have, yeah. You know what?

73
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.980
We'll have a hand Kim, uh, future mark. We'll hopefully flip this. I mean,

74
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.590
it kind of looks fine like this, but we'll see. We'll see. All right,

75
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.360
so I'm moving this up top. We're gonna take this mechanical keyboard back. Now,

76
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
this isn't the same mechanical keyboards or bad membrane keyboards, better,

77
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.193
or vice versa,

78
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.570
simply personal preference and more so to say that if you're trying to just

79
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.850
type fast and you think you need a mechanical keyboard,

80
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.600
you don't equipment is important, but to some degree,

81
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
it's not because all equipment is up to such a good level at this point. Okay.

82
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.190
Now there will be bias here, unavoidably,

83
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.340
because if I believe that I can type faster with,

84
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.360
or type faster with this membrane keyboard than the mechanical keyboard than

85
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.990
obviously I probably will. At the same time I'm using this one second.

86
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.430
So fatigue, I don't know.

87
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.430
That's up to you to decide this is simply a video to say that yes,

88
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.720
membrane ghosting is a thing I am aware of it, but is it really a problem?

89
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.790
And I'm happy to, I'm so excited to return to the, the, this thin surface. Um,

90
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.770
and it was $30 versus 300. So,

91
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.480
so we wanted 1 56 or better with a 92% accuracy or better

92
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.890
repeat. Okay.

93
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.360
Oh, oh no. Oh no. It shows the, okay.

94
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.850
So I decided we're going to go ahead and stick with the new test.

95
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.780
Cause that ghost cursor, whoops, is going to freak me out, not freak me out,

96
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.300
but like, it's going to throw me off because I'm going to always try to beat it.

97
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.440
Um, which is great to have. So keep in mind that monkey type does that, but,

98
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.110
uh, it has like,

99
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.960
it makes it pushes me and I don't need something to push me right now. So, okay.

100
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.040
I just made a bunch of typos on that one. We're going to try one more time.

101
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.300
1 58, the da,

102
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.650
and that was with typos and backspacing so personally I typed better on this

103
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.470
when it comes to typing tests and I think it'll help in general.

104
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.840
I just prefer it it's it's much. I dunno, you know,

105
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.190
this isn't a slam on the 60% keyboard. I mean, this is smaller,

106
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.570
but it also has arrow keys. So it's going to,

107
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.270
it's going to be more important for my editing workflow, whatever, all in all,

108
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.260
like, you know, if something works for you, keep using it, right.

109
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.370
If something doesn't work, then try it. But in every hobby profession I've done,

110
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.910
there's always been all. I can't do this because X you know,

111
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.070
because I don't have X, I can't, you know,

112
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.670
draw digitally because I don't have a good whack on tablet. Uh, I can't,

113
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.820
I can't type fast or fast cause this is my keyboards bad.

114
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.500
There are bad keyboards, but this is $30. I can hit almost one 60 on.

115
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.020
It felt possible. You know, in theory I can hit 1 67.

116
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.130
So I will be officially retiring this keyboard.

117
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.110
I'm still gonna hold onto it in case I ever want to do like a rating video,

118
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.850
but just listen, just listen to this ready

119
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.850
Versus this.

120
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.120
It's just, it's just quieter. It's smoother.

121
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.960
It's a flatter surface on the top of the keyboard, whatever. There's no script.

122
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.370
I don't know. Is there anything else I should say?

123
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.080
So the gamma K K 60

124
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.950
officially being retired. So from here on out,

125
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.110
if you see this Logitech boy in my videos, this is why I would genuinely maybe,

126
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.180
you know, if this keys were squared, that would be nice,

127
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.090
but I'll get used to it in like four days on my way back from best buy.

128
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.460
I was like, can I make a video to this still? And I was like, wait a minute.

129
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.120
Yes I can.

130
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.630
Because I've gotten so many comments as to what keyboard do I use on the,

131
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.690
on the last, on my first typing videos, it was like, what keyboard do you use?

132
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.840
That was the MK four 70 Logitech Bluetooth keyboard.

133
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.400
And this is the K three 80, but like, it doesn't matter what keyboard you have.

134
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.060
As long as it's, you know, some modern keyboard, you're going to be fine.

135
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.420
I've said this 20 times, but to wrap this all up, all in all,

136
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.100
if you're wanting to type fast, you know,

137
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.640
I made a video all about this concept and why it's kind of not relevant anymore.

138
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.970
Like you don't need to type fast, at least not above like 80 words a minute,

139
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.030
really more. You don't need a mechanical keyboard. Now,

140
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.950
if you want a mechanical keyboard, by all means like, go for one. If you,

141
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.100
you know, if you want whatever,

142
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.980
but I literally went to best buy today because I really wanted this new

143
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.850
mechanical keyboard.

144
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.560
And I have a very hard time justifying very expensive things like that.

145
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.380
But it's been several months when I went there, I was like, you know what?

146
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.800
I'm so sick of the mechanical keyboard I have right now.

147
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.540
Let me just get one of these crappy ones.

148
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.260
And I almost got the one I had the MK four 70, but then this one was cheaper.

149
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.260
And I was like, Ooh, just roll with that for a little while.

150
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.510
Can I hit 180 words per minute with a $30 keyboard,

151
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.010
could posture feet on the ground.

152
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.490
One 50. Um, I will say up here,

153
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.730
I felt that where the raw was like 180.

154
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.450
I felt that for like those 10 words, I think I can hit 180 with this keyboard.

155
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.530
It will take a minute to get used to it.

156
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.310
And if I hadn't failed 59 seconds of a test beforehand, because of no hand cam,

157
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.550
I think I would have been fine. So yeah, that's the video for 30 bucks.

158
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.790
Great keyboard. It's not really a tech review, but just a point to say, like,

159
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.930
if you, if you want tips on keyboards and how to type fast,

160
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.100
like check out my other videos,

161
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.640
but also just know from someone who makes typing videos,

162
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.460
this is fine. That is all I'm trying to say. This totally works.

163
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.190
And actually I really like it. It's nice and small.

164
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.650
It feels like a 2d S versus a 3d as I don't have a two years,

165
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.010
but it's held one anyway. That's enough rambling. Thank you for watching. Again,

166
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.930
more typing content. Uh,

167
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.000
you can find out if you'd like to learn how to type faster,

168
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.810
but I also make language videos and productivity and lifestyle videos.

169
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.700
So keep an eye out for those. Uh, so without further ado,

170
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.960
have a good one and as always, don't forget to stay awesome.

171
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.040
See you next week.
