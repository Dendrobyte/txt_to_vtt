00:00:00:02 - 00:00:14:05
Mark
Hey, Internet. Welcome back to another video, if you're new here and you don't know me already, my name is Mark. I'm currently a senior studying linguistics and computer science. NYU graduating in like a month. Well done with my degree in a month, graduating in January.

00:00:14:07 - 00:00:25:05
Mark
But anyway, welcome back to language learning log number ten. If you've been learning your own language, Spanish, Korean, whatever it might be. Leave a comment. Let me know how it's going today. I get to update you on how it's going.

00:00:25:05 - 00:00:37:21
Mark
For me, it's pretty slow. The premise of this learning log is to keep me accountable in some ways such that I can, you know, give you updates every single month or at least every four weeks, and keep track of my progress as a sense of documentation.

00:00:37:22 - 00:00:51:11
Mark
They started out as a summer thing where every two weeks I would make one of these. And that allowed for really fast integration. And something that I neglected to consider was that I would release a video and iterate upon my learning method.

00:00:51:28 - 00:01:06:26
Mark
With the release of that video, so I kept that habit. But the problem is I'm now iterating every month. Not a great idea, so I should. So now I'll talk about it in a minute. But going forward, I have a task to check in with my methodology and iterate every, you know, week or so.

00:01:06:28 - 00:01:18:09
Mark
I say that because it took me too long to realize that the weekly blocks were not working, but without getting too deeply into that will save that for the reflection section or whatever. I would like to reference this video here.

00:01:18:10 - 00:01:31:07
Mark
I was frustrated with a lot of things in that context of that video. It was not reading enough, and Japanese is something I've also been frustrated with because my progress has been a snail's crawl. Slow. I'll discuss. You know what?

00:01:31:07 - 00:01:45:18
Mark
I gave it some thought this past week while writing the script for this video, and so I'll be discussing that just a moment. For some reason, the following bullet point is in the introduction section kind of incredible how a human memory is a challenge of discipline and we can constantly learn new things that's occurred is something just

00:01:45:18 - 00:02:01:02
Mark
occurred to me anyway, onto methodology. So starting off, one Cunningham Boom Pro are working rather well now. Boone has been slow because it's more difficult to do in a sense, even though the grammar is fascinating and as can be straightforward at some points.

00:02:01:12 - 00:02:12:13
Mark
Yeah, one economy and Boom Pro The notion of them being easy is simply because I can sit down and I know exactly what I'm doing. one thing I have noticed is that I will need to figure out how to write Kanji.

00:02:13:04 - 00:02:23:14
Mark
I can visualize them in the sense that like, I can recognize them well, but all of a sudden it it becomes a bit of a challenge as they get more and more complex. Here is the current status of one economy.

00:02:23:14 - 00:02:36:26
Mark
Last month, I set aside the goal to hit Level eight, and I definitely could have made it. It has been a very crammed and very stressful couple of weeks with classes and job search and whatever. I do have a 198 reviews.

00:02:37:07 - 00:02:51:09
Mark
Those have all piled up in the last day just because of how much I have been getting done. Whatever. I had 80 lessons for like a week and a half. one economy is still super, very super, very helpful and Boon Pro in line with the fact you can sit down and do something.

00:02:51:16 - 00:03:02:08
Mark
I will be talking a lot about in a couple of minutes. It took about five or so days to actually get to Level seven. In other words, when the lessons unlocked, I had them sitting there for like a week.

00:03:02:08 - 00:03:13:10
Mark
But I can just I can get the best. I have found the method. You just once you get the radicals down the kanji, then it's it's quick. I just didn't have the mental space in a way. So this is Boon Pro.

00:03:13:11 - 00:03:24:22
Mark
My progress on Boom Pro, as you can see. Not great. You know, this is no surprise or whatever. But one of my goals from last week tying it in was to finish the essential grammar, basic grammar, basic grammar section of the textbook.

00:03:24:22 - 00:03:40:29
Mark
And I did. And so I just unlocked the following been for lessons I just have not been doing it consistently, as you can see by the graph, whatever, wherever that is, my new iteration is on Saturdays to spend like a solid hour, hour and a half chunk of textbook work in Japanese.

00:03:41:10 - 00:03:50:25
Mark
Just maybe I'll start with an hour. See how it goes because I don't want to try and cram too much into my head. But like really mindful learning, what I noted was in these small blocks because they're flexible.

00:03:51:02 - 00:04:03:18
Mark
Other words, they're an internal deadline. They could constantly get moved around for more important things. And with the lack of, I guess, mental commitment as of late, for many things, Japanese included. And again, I think I should be speaking right now, but I can't.

00:04:03:18 - 00:04:18:19
Mark
There's a notion that if you're learning guitar, it's better to practice for 15 minutes every day, as opposed to three hours every other six days or whatever. And I totally agree with this notion, but I realized that because of one economy boom pro, I am still practicing every day.

00:04:18:25 - 00:04:32:19
Mark
I don't need to be doing the textbook day. I think textbook should be in-depth learning sessions kind of like how a class is like one chapter a week. So now it's, you know, do an hour of grammar study very well, like grammar setting, but very specifically textbook study and throughout the week.

00:04:32:19 - 00:04:45:17
Mark
Do you want to come in and boom pro? And that's the big iteration thing that I want to mention here. Having the sessions throughout the week was just a lot of pressure, I think. And if I'm losing my connection and motivation to learning Japanese, I don't think it's I don't think I actually am.

00:04:45:17 - 00:04:56:27
Mark
It's just very busy week month, in fact, mentally. The summer was nice because I could really prioritize Japanese, and I'm looking forward to prioritizing it again in December while I'm on a break. I haven't looked extensively at papers.

00:04:56:27 - 00:05:07:18
Mark
There was a cool paper I found about left notebooks. In Japanese, I'm not going to bother trying to explain it while I could read it, I don't know well enough to try and explain it. Some of the linguistic stuff is still fascinating.

00:05:07:18 - 00:05:24:28
Mark
It's just like it can be very convoluted, so I don't know. I think it's cool. If you notice a sentence in Japan, if you're learning a language, I should say. If you notice a sentence, it's weird. It can be worth looking it up because in linguistic academia, people literally look at specific sentences and specific phenomena.

00:05:24:29 - 00:05:38:22
Mark
All in all, I genuinely should be able to speak right now. I should be able to come with generic sentences and have a very basic conversation, but I can't. I have been busy and I should have attempted this one big block thing earlier, which is the notion I was saying about how I should not be iterating every

00:05:38:22 - 00:05:53:10
Mark
month, but still every week or so. But I'm really hoping it'll work out for the remaining months in my last semester if I can apply my vocab and such to learn how I think. And speaking personally, I think production is very, very, very, very important.

00:05:53:27 - 00:06:04:14
Mark
But if I can't use the vocab in one economy, if I don't know how to take a verb and properly conjugate it, there's no point. one economy is going to fade because if you don't use a skill, you are going to forget it.

00:06:04:24 - 00:06:16:20
Mark
If you if I know a bunch of vocab, but then I never use it in language, I'm going to forget it because the end goal here is, you know, in eleven or twelve more months. one economy will be complete and I'll be done with it.

00:06:16:29 - 00:06:28:12
Mark
And I don't, you know, maybe I'll check back in every once in a blue moon. But I will remember the vocab because I will be speaking Japanese. I hopefully often enough, but that's a problem for later, because this is the methodology section I just want.

00:06:29:19 - 00:06:45:26
Mark
How do I not know how to drink water? Well, notes are just unhelpful to me. Fall of 2020, that took five classes and I wrote notes, handwritten online paper, and at the end of every single day I typed them up mark.

00:06:45:26 - 00:06:56:28
Mark
Throw a notion thing here and it didn't help. Sure, I paid attention, but it didn't help me, so I told myself I would never have to take class notes again. Here we are. Sometimes I still drop things out, but anyway, that's my method.

00:06:56:28 - 00:07:08:09
Mark
That's what works for me, whatever. Don't use this as an excuse to not take notes. Long story short, I had some notes for the essential grammar section or whatever, but I just stopped because I was writing down things and it was limiting my knowledge.

00:07:08:09 - 00:07:17:22
Mark
And I figure the book itself is short enough that I can just constantly reference it. And so using the book and doing Mindful Boon Pro, for example, if I look at something, I'm like, What is this grammar rule saying?

00:07:17:22 - 00:07:27:21
Mark
I just find in the book my notes are not going to be more helpful. Sure, writing things down helps memorize them, but we're not going for rote memorization here. We're going for an innate understanding of grammar. To wrap up, that's been my methodology.

00:07:27:21 - 00:07:42:11
Mark
This daily one economy boon pro. Very automated thing. Here you go. Do this. We're going to come out of this in a minute and then the grammar guide as well. And of course, I've been listening to music. one of my goals was to read Haiku, which I have and have not been doing.

00:07:42:11 - 00:07:53:20
Mark
So I definitely started it. I got it like a few pages in and it took me about 30 minutes. As you can see by this little doggy ear, whatever. But it's really cool to kind of see kanji that I recognize in motion.

00:07:53:20 - 00:08:08:09
Mark
The grammar rules are not there yet, but they will get there. Next month is December, and I really want to finish the Essentials Grammar section. I don't know if I will because I would rather do half of it and get really good at it as opposed to do the whole thing and be really bad at it, which

00:08:08:09 - 00:08:18:01
Mark
, you know, I can see reasons for either one. Yes, I've been reading music, of course. Oh, I've been trying to think in Japanese. So if I'm having an internal dialog with myself, I'll be like, Okay, how can I?

00:08:18:01 - 00:08:30:14
Mark
You know, how can I say this otherwise? And that's how I learned that I can't speak in watching enemy. I have been hearing utterances or sentences, and I'll be like, I know all of that. I can actually break every part down.

00:08:30:17 - 00:08:42:08
Mark
The Elrick Brothers and Fullmetal Alchemist. Yes, it's 2021, and I haven't seen it yet. Like Jodi, it's like, Oh, brothers! And then over time, you hear these words over and over again, and you can finally put them into a context.

00:08:42:08 - 00:08:54:10
Mark
And as you take these abstract memorization of things and put them into a context, which to me is the science or the methodology behind memory mnemonics. When you put things into a context, they become usable when they become usable.

00:08:54:10 - 00:09:04:15
Mark
You don't forget them. So, OK, anyway, reflections section quick note on the whiteboard. I did this for my vlogs ages ago. Some dreams have to die for new ones to come alive. I leave you with that food for thought.

00:09:04:16 - 00:09:14:16
Mark
But the notes on the notion board, this is the section of the learning log where I look at the things I've written down as the last month has evolved. OK, I have a reference to Outer while the game I played, I don't know.

00:09:14:16 - 00:09:26:01
Mark
I don't know what I meant, though, putting in conscious effort to let the easy work come later. Active learning turns into passive reinforcement. Don't know what the context of this one was, but it really ties into the notion of putting in a conscious effort for textbook study.

00:09:26:11 - 00:09:39:04
Mark
And then, you know, hearing music, watching anime, passively reinforcing these these concepts. It's kind of like active income and passive income where you work really hard to make money and then you're passive income is like the effect of that hard work.

00:09:39:05 - 00:09:50:23
Mark
Some screenshots from October 15th when I went to geo caching. So the first one and I'll throw them up here is of a song the first. So I recognized the kanji in this. And so the first one is hit.

00:09:51:06 - 00:10:05:01
Mark
The second one is above, the third one is flour and the last one is fire and fire flower. Hanadi is a firework and I recognize all the kanji this. I don't know what hit above flour fire means. Maybe it's the vocab word where it doesn't mean anything remotely to that.

00:10:06:14 - 00:10:21:19
Mark
Next up is a picture of geo caching on the bottom. There is the the wo particle which turns oh, and then center. So and then the NI Protocol, which is a good directional particle. So it's like in the center and that means to center the like.

00:10:21:20 - 00:10:37:20
Mark
If you click it, it puts you in the center of the map. So I imagine it's like your avatar or cursor as the object of being centered a TV show. Someone's name is Ishikawa. And then I saw the kanji on like a uniform or whatever, and I was like, Oh my God, stone and river like, whoa, Ishikawa

00:10:37:21 - 00:10:53:04
Mark
. And it's the vocab reading for both of them. Boon Pro reviews are regular hearing I once once I've been learning about these particles more and like what they're paired with, you know, trends of intransitive verbs and stuff. It's easier to hear them.

00:10:53:04 - 00:11:04:04
Mark
So segmentation is actually becoming easy. Dare I say it's one thing for a language not to sound like total mumbo jumbo, but it's another thing to be like, Oh, I just caught a particle. The thing they said must have related to this part of the subtitles or whatever.

00:11:04:04 - 00:11:13:15
Mark
And I'm also at the point where, like, sometimes I think, hmm, I don't know if the subtitles accurately portrayed the utterance, something I found out about Boon Pro that is very cool is that you can incorporate it with one economy.

00:11:13:15 - 00:11:26:03
Mark
I didn't realize this. Maybe I mentioned this in the last learning log, but I'm still flabbergasted. And so it'll show you the candy that you've been learning and like, not show you the pronunciation of it because you should not thoughts on production and how having to verbalize these things sort of requires an internalization of them.

00:11:26:15 - 00:11:43:03
Mark
Yeah, I've been looking into this super category of politeness. So in French to vu in Japanese sun versus Chan versus summer, and if there's a way you know to view is kind of internalized to me, I don't have to say if a person is above me, use view f friend used to.

00:11:43:04 - 00:11:55:27
Mark
So internalizing these is probably as an adult, a matter of just implicitly memorizing the. He's doing it so much that it becomes habit. Yes, October 18th is when I started level six and again, I definitely could be on.

00:11:55:27 - 00:12:07:03
Mark
I could be halfway through eight. Now I just when there were 90 lessons in like 200 reviews, I was like, I'm going to knock out the reviews first. Helpful to identify what I was going to do in my active session as opposed to deciding to do do during.

00:12:07:04 - 00:12:19:12
Mark
Yeah. So I realized that when I was sitting down to read textbook stuff, it's much easier. Like if I had something on my calendar, it's much easier to say, OK, do the noun related particles in this hour a block or half hour block.

00:12:19:18 - 00:12:30:11
Mark
Don't just sit down and do Japanese and decide it at the point. Make these decisions ahead of time because the less decisions you have to make some notion of failing to understand for production. So I need to start writing and is right.

00:12:30:16 - 00:12:41:14
Mark
This is what I realized at the book. If I can't speak right now, then don't because I am someone who speaks very fast. As one of the biggest things I got in these videos is slow down, and so I tried to be more concise and enunciate more.

00:12:41:15 - 00:12:54:18
Mark
But as a result, if I can't speak fast or read fast, it just frustrates me. And so I think writing will be my my outlet for production. I have a bunch of lined paper here, and I also printed out Frank.

00:12:54:19 - 00:13:07:10
Mark
I forget what it's called, but the up and down paper, the up and down paper gingko shou, I think it's going to get across you. It's funny hearing all these words, not because you can actually understand like where they come from.

00:13:07:10 - 00:13:17:15
Mark
It becomes, you know, Boone Perot is not Boone Perot. It's writing Perot. It's it's a pun. Because I know that the first one is writing how with how fast I can read English. The pace of Japanese is jarring.

00:13:17:15 - 00:13:36:04
Mark
In video games. I will zoom through dialog because I can read very fast and you don't have to internalize a lot of knowledge. It is, you know, starting up Pokémon. Let's go Eevee in Japanese is. I have to sit there for five minutes on a one dialog box and it's like, Oh, what?

00:13:36:04 - 00:13:49:03
Mark
I could usually be done in like a half a second. Probably little exaggeration there. But yeah, so yes, I'm going to try working on his time. Azaria's I already talked about that. So a long block and then reinforcing throughout the week long block, three and four, so on and so forth.

00:13:49:03 - 00:14:00:19
Mark
Maybe take a break here and there. Yeah, watching. So lastly, watching an episode of anime with no subtitles and I just felt a lot less clueless. It's been like two weeks since I did this. This was yesterday. I watched one and I was like, Oh my God, I'm watching.

00:14:01:02 - 00:14:14:13
Mark
So again, without subtitles, because I remember the story pretty well, but I can't quite tell what's going on, but I'm getting better at growing familiar with the language and hearing things that I do not understand. In other words, what actually is me as well, and various numbers.

00:14:14:13 - 00:14:29:28
Mark
So hearing, you know, Ju Goku or something, ju Goku. That's not right. I just combine five and six. And so I'm thinking of maybe trying to watch a short show without subtitles. So an anime without subtitles and then going back and rewatching with subtitles to see what I picked up when I got out of it.

00:14:30:11 - 00:14:46:25
Mark
This is not a new idea. This is something I've been meaning to try. But yeah, and the lastly, in the reflection section, I had this epiphany about kanji. So they have a video idea talking about the beauty of Japanese as phonetic system, and it ends with a joke of like, Why the hell are we using kanji?

00:14:46:25 - 00:15:01:05
Mark
Then I know that I've already tried explaining this to someone, and I know it's the stupidest thing. But if you go on to your phone and you look for the emoji keyboard, which by the way, is electronic letter like emoji is letter, so emoji email.

00:15:01:05 - 00:15:14:19
Mark
If you go on there and you go on to your emoji keyboard and you type in something like the word B a b shows up if like a b a bumblebee. If you type in the word bumble, you get a b the same exact B emoji.

00:15:15:03 - 00:15:32:08
Mark
Now emojis are. Significantly less arbitrary than kanji, however, an emoji has one image and multiple sounds associated with it. Do you see where I'm going with this? I just have this weird epiphany that kanji are effectively arbitrary emojis.

00:15:34:13 - 00:15:45:09
Mark
But so are words. You know, you look at the word, hello, it's not like you. You see it enough. It's not like you see yellow, you see hello. There was a word and you just read it, you internalize it.

00:15:48:01 - 00:16:05:16
Mark
It's just it's a stupid epiphany. But I I was I blew my own mind. I was come back to the bathroom and was like, Wait a second. Emojis are just kanji, but not arbitrary goals. Wrapping this up with goals, given these larger time blocks, I need to get through the basic grammar section of this textbook.

00:16:05:17 - 00:16:19:00
Mark
It's more or less not an option. So if I go ahead and look special expressions gets into causative and passive verbs, dare I say that's exciting. So Page 75 to 182, I'm not going to set a goal for myself to finish this chapter.

00:16:19:02 - 00:16:32:29
Mark
I am, however, going to set a goal to make significant headway such that I can speak, or at least, you know, actually use more slow motion verbs, new particles, whatever, just significant headway because I just don't feel like I made any with with the basic grammar section.

00:16:33:16 - 00:16:42:23
Mark
My first goal will be getting my commitment back on track and setting small milestones. So what I have done? Future mark, go ahead. Just grab a quick screenshot from to do it. Oh, so if I go into my lifestyle.

00:16:42:23 - 00:16:53:15
Mark
VIDEO Here's here's this the called small learning, low tech and clip. So I will have a section of the wedding log where I'll just throw in like a 32nd clip of Here's what worked. Here's what's not working or here's what's working on.

00:16:53:15 - 00:17:04:05
Mark
I'm going to keep doing it. You know, maybe this week hasn't been enough to to say anything strong. And then I also in one economy, there are simple sentences, and if you press the JAKEY after you get something right or wrong, it'll play the audio.

00:17:04:13 - 00:17:15:13
Mark
So I want to actually make use of that because I need to get used to the sounds. I want to spend a focused couple of weeks learning the phonology of Japanese so that I can actually pronounce properly. It's not.

00:17:15:29 - 00:17:30:17
Mark
You know what, Hashimoto Watusi whites who are fashionable. What? Actually, you know, there's there's a there's a difference. I can't I'm not great at articulating that difference, but the hours are all right. In a sense. I wish I could do a sprint like I did in the summer.

00:17:30:17 - 00:17:44:25
Mark
So maybe I'll set aside huge works blocks in Thanksgiving. So treat. This Thanksgiving break is like I'm probably going to get a head on a lot of my schoolwork, just going to wrap things up 90% over Thanksgiving. That's my goal at least, and burn myself out over like two or three days.

00:17:45:04 - 00:17:56:15
Mark
So I can, you know, take a couple of days and do nothing as a holistic reflection on my Japanese. Lately, I have been doing about 10% of the work I should be doing and about 2% of the work I am expecting of myself.

00:17:56:15 - 00:18:05:10
Mark
So do it that way. You will. The Japanese as a priority is a commitment that I want to be here and it is being treated as though it is here. He puts his hand at the light as if it's a good choice.

00:18:05:18 - 00:18:18:05
Mark
You know, I can say as much as I can, I want to about picking things back up, but I know Saturdays don't have much going on. I put in a long learning. And it's just nice not having to stress about each day having to do something.

00:18:18:17 - 00:18:36:26
Mark
It's just this one here and then reviews, I know I will inevitably do so. That is it for Japanese learning. Log number ten. I had originally thought of signing up. I wanted to sign up for the job and five, which is on December fifth, but it's filled up too quickly and I mean, obviously I'm not on track

00:18:36:26 - 00:18:49:09
Mark
to do that. However, I still think it's it's a good metric to hit. So I think by the end of 2021, I want to be done with the five stuff I'm doing, according to Boone Pro, and be able to go through the workbook, it's up there somewhere.

00:18:50:08 - 00:19:00:21
Mark
I also forgot about the short stories book that I have. Haikus is more fun, I guess, but this is starting to tie in with this larger issue of not reading. So I'm not going to hold myself to any reading standards.

00:19:00:21 - 00:19:12:16
Mark
But in 2022, I'd love to be able to read Haiku. Read the essay. Oh, visual novels I got because I want to get Yeah, I just. Anyway, I'm going to wrap it up. No need to go on any longer.
